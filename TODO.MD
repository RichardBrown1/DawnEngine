# TODO

## Thoughts
- Convert to F16 
- 4 Binding Groups regrouped to order eg static / scene, infrequent, frequent, per-frame
-- Investigate Bind Order
--- Should static and moving object transforms be put together or separate?
--- Bind Visibility 
--- Bind Type
- Preprocessor Macro Binding and Binding Group or maybe just create a central registry to manage it neatly?
